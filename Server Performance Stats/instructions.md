## Features

- ðŸ“Š Real-time system performance metrics
- ðŸ’» CPU and memory usage statistics
- ðŸ’¾ Disk space utilization
- ðŸ‘¥ Currently logged-in users
- ðŸ”’ Failed login attempt tracking
- âš¡ Top resource-consuming processes

## Prerequisites

- Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- Bash shell
- Root/sudo access (for failed login attempts)

## What This Script Monitors

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **OS Information** | Operating system name and version |
| **Uptime** | How long the system has been running |
| **Load Average** | System load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes |
| **Logged-in Users** | Currently active users |
| **CPU Usage** | Total CPU utilization percentage |
| **Memory Usage** | RAM consumption and availability |
| **Disk Usage** | Overall disk space utilization |
| **Top Processes** | Most resource-intensive processes |
| **Failed Logins** | Recent unsuccessful login attempts |

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied**: Ensure the script has execute permissions
- **Failed login section missing**: Run with `sudo` or check if `/var/log/auth.log` exists
- **Command not found**: Verify all required utilities are installed (`top`, `ps`, `free`, `df`)
